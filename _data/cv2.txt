    Research_Interests:
      - My research interest lies in the area of **computer assisted intervention (CAI)** and **robotic surgery**, with the mission to raise the level of surgery autonomy and intelligence, relieve the surgery burden and improve surgery safety. My previous research experience mostly lies in **medical image analysis** and **perception** for robotic surgery, including **image segmentation**, **image registration** (rigid and deformable), surgical instrument **pose estimation**, **tissue deformation recovery**, and **digital twin** for soft tissue manipulation in robotic surgery. My current and future work include **visual servoing** for surgery autonomy and laparoscopic image-based **biomechanical analysis** as extra modality for surgical guidance and assessment.
