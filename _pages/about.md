I am currently a PostDoctroal researcher of the [Biomedical Precision Engineering Lab (BMPE)](https://www.bmpe.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.html), in the School of Engineering at [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/).

My research interest lies in the area of computer assisted intervention (CAI) and robotic surgery, with the mission to raise the level of surgery autonomy and intelligence, relieve the surgery burden and improve surgery safety. My previous research experience mostly lies in **medical image analysis** and **perception** for robotic surgery, including **image segmentation**, **image registration** (rigid and deformable), surgical instrument **pose estimation**, **tissue deformation recovery**, and **digital twin** for soft tissue manipulation in robotic surgery. My current and future work include **visual servoing** for surgery autonomy and laparoscopic image-based **biomechanical analysis** as extra modality for surgical guidance and assessment.

I received my PhD degree in [Precision Engineering](https://www.pe.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) at The University of Tokyo in 2025 supervised by *Professor* Etsuko Kobayashi, Master degree in [Biomedical Engineering](https://bioeng.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) at The University of Tokyo in 2022 supervised by *Professor*, and Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering at Beihang University in 2020 supervised by *Professor* Junchen Wang. Between 2019 and 2020, I was an exchange/visiting student at the [Computer Aided Medical Procedures Lab](https://campar.in.tum.de/WebHome), Technical University of Munich, and [Lee Ultrasound Imaging Group](https://www.eee.hku.hk/~wnlee/), The University of Hong Kong.
