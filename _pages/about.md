I am currently a PhD student of the [Biomedical Precision Engineering Lab (BMPE)](https://www.bmpe.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/index.html), in the [Department of Precision Engineering](https://www.pe.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/index.html) at [The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/), supervised by [*Professor* Etsuko Kobayashi](https://www.bmpe.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/member.html).

My research interest lies in the area of computer assisted intervention (CAI) and robotic surgery, with the mission to raise the level of surgery autonomy and intelligence, relieve the surgery burden and improve surgery safety. My previous research experience mostly lies in **medical image analysis** and **perception** for robotic surgery, including **image segmentation**, **image registration** (rigid and deformable), **tissue deformation recovery**, and **digital twin** for soft tissue manipulation in robotic surgery. My current and future work include **visual servoing** for surgery autonomy and laparoscopic image-based **biomechanical analysis** as extra modality for surgical guidance and assessment.

I received my Master degree in [Biomedical Engineering](https://bioeng.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) at The University of Tokyo](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/) in 2022, and Bachelor degree in Mechanical Engineering at Beihang University in 2020.
